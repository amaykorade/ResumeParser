**Note:**  The "Projects" section details projects undertaken, which could be considered part of work experience or a separate category depending on how you want to organize the information.  I've chosen not to include it directly under "Work Experience" given it doesn't list a formal employer. The "Trainings" section is also omitted as it's not work experience in the traditional sense.
